        <p>Calder Engine is a 2D game engine that I built from the ground up for EECS 498: Game Engine Architecture. 
          The engine supports Lua scripting, physics, 2D rendering, and more. 
          Additionally, I added support for 2D skeletal animation as a custom feature:</p>

        <p>C-Note is an educational application that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to help introduce students to sound design.
          C-Note was created for EECS 498: Extended Reality and Society, as part of a team of 5 students over the course of 4 weeks.
          C-Note is designed with children in mind, and features a set of physical puzzle pieces that are used in conjunction with the AR app to create an immersive and interactive learning experience.
          With C-Note, students can explore the intricate process of sound design by manipulating a variety of virtual sound objects, such as selecting the sound waveform, and chaining effects like distortion, reverb, and chorus together.
          For this project, my contributions include:
