        <p>Sweetcore Brews is an original romance visual novel about a young witch who runs a magical tea shop. 
          I have been working on this game with Nochi Studios as a gameplay programming intern, starting Summer 2023. Some of my contributions include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fully developed two versions of Mad Libs minigame (both a PC and mobile version)</li>
          <li>Owned development of AR experience; players buy and scan physical merch to experience their favorite characters in augmented reality</li>
          <li>Visual effects: Shaders, particle effects, popups, transitions, and other UI effects</li>
          <li>Backend: Integrating Unity app, Squarespace website, Firebase database and Google sheets to track customer account data</li>

      detail: (<div>
        <p>C-Note is an educational application that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to help introduce students to sound design.
          C-Note was created for EECS 498: Extended Reality and Society, as part of a team of 5 students over the course of 4 weeks.
          C-Note is designed with children in mind, and features a set of physical puzzle pieces that are used in conjunction with the AR app to create an immersive and interactive learning experience.
          With C-Note, students can explore the intricate process of sound design by manipulating a variety of virtual sound objects, such as selecting the sound waveform, and chaining effects like distortion, reverb, and chorus together.
          For this project, my contributions include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>UI/UX design</li>
          <li>App features: AR image tracking, songbook, AR UI, app UI</li>
          <li>Art integration: 3D animations</li>
          <li>Some work on the in-app synthesizer using FMOD</li>
